## How to make enrolment decisions on incoming students

### Making an enrolment decision as the host university

1. Right click on the table labeled as "enrolment_business_decision", click on "View/Edit Data, click on "all rows"
    - Each row within that table is a separate enrolment.
    - The "status" column is where you will change the enrolment decision to one of the [enrolment states](#enrolment-states).
    - When first seeing the table any enrolments that we have not made a decision on should be labeled as "NOT_CONSIDERED".

2. Double-click on the status of the enrolment, type in a new enrolment status, and click "OK"
    - _Remember_: the status can only be input in upper-case
    - If you would like to see more information regarding the student and the enrolment see the following [section](#seeing-more-incoming-student-information).

3. If you are certain about the decision, change the "send_status_to_home" field to __true__
    - Click on the checkbox until it changes to a checkmark, then it will be true

4. Click on the button labeled as "Save Data Changes"
